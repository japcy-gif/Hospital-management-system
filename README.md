üìÑ Abstract
The healthcare industry continually seeks efficient and scalable systems to manage administrative tasks, patient records, and clinical workflows. This project introduces a console-based Hospital Management System developed in Java, utilizing JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for seamless interaction with a MySQL relational database.

üè• Project Highlights
Core Features:

          Patient registration
          
          Doctor management
          
          Appointment scheduling
          
          Programming Concepts Used:

Core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles

          Modular class design (Patient, Doctor, and HospitalManagementSystem)
          
          Command-line interface (CLI) for platform independence

üóÉÔ∏è Backend & Database
          Uses a MySQL database with three normalized tables:
          
          patients, doctors, and appointments
          
          Enforces data integrity using:
          
          Primary & foreign key constraints

Input validations

          SQL Prepared Statements to prevent SQL injection
          
          Performs backend checks like:
          
          Verifying valid patient/doctor IDs
          
          Avoiding double-booking of doctor appointments

‚öôÔ∏è Error Handling & Security
          Comprehensive exception handling
          
          Secure and reliable database operations
          
          Handles:
          
          Invalid inputs
          
          Connection issues
          
          Logical errors

üîß Design Principles
Focused on:

          Modularity
          
          Reusability
          
          Scalability
          
          Lays groundwork for future upgrades such as:
          
          JavaFX GUI integration
          
          Role-based access control

Reporting and analytics tools

‚úÖ Conclusion
This Hospital Management System stands as a functional prototype for digitizing clinical workflows in small to mid-sized healthcare setups. It showcases how Java's robustness combined with MySQL's relational strength can create a secure, extensible, and maintainable healthcare solution.
